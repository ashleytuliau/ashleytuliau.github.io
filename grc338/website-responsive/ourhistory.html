            <p>
                Almost 60 years ago, Rich Harbour’s prized, albeit beat-up and used surfboard was stolen from his parents’ garage, forcing him to shape one of his own as a replacement. It wasn’t long before many of the locals were asking
                Rich to make them surfboards. Soon Harbour’s boards were gracing the pages of Surfer Magazine underneath the feet of the era’s most respected surfers. While a lot has changed since that first board, Harbour Surfboards

                craftsmanship and attention to design as the philosophy behind each surfboard. Harbour’s position as a trend-setter in the industry and evolving designs are still going strong. And today, both new and vintage Harbour
