            <h2>Target audience</h2>
            
            <p>The target audience is people who value comfort but don't want to sacrifice style. The projected cutomer is always on the go and wants clothes that can keep up with a busy, diverse lifestyle. I could see this ihncluding a lot of female college students, young athletes, or even mothers who are always on the go. Overall, anyone who wants to be comfortable and flexible while still getting that California-cool stye.</p><!-- Who are the people who use this site? -->
           
            <p>The primary goal is to make sure the fabirics and materials are all high quality. Each piece should be made for comfort and also made to last. Additionally, materials and designs that are made to be sweat-proof as well as move with you as you weart them is a primary goal. Additionally, capturing the personality and lifestly of Southern California in each clothing item is very important to stay true to the brand identity.</p><!-- What are their primary task and goals? -->
